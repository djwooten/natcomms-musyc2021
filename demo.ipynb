    "An interactive demo of the MuSyC synergy model, showing how the single-drug and synergy parameters control the dose-response surface. The top 6 sliders (E1, E2, log(C1), log(C2), log(h1), and log(h2)) describe single drug response parameters. The next 5 sliders (beta, log(alp12), log(alp21), log(gam12), log(gam21)) are MuSyC's synergy parameters. Parameters which range from 0 to +infinity (C, h, alpha, gamma) are controlled by sliders on a log scale. The \"Reset\" button sets the sliders to their original values. The other buttons automatically adjust the sliders to make the dose-response surface match the indicated null model. (Note: when log(alpha) is set to -3.00 on the slider, it is interpreted for the visualization as alpha=0, which is required to match the Loewe null model).\n",
    "\n",
    "When beta=0, the combination plateaus at Emax of the stronger single drug. Adjusting the sliders for either E1 or E2 will show that whenever one drug becomes stronger than the other, the strength of the combination at high doses follows E of the stronger drug. Adjusting the beta slider will further increase or decrease the efficacy at high concentrations of both drugs, relative to the stronger drug.\n",

    "Adjusting the C1 slider will shift the potency of drug 1 across the entire dose-response surface, while the alpha21 slider has a larger impact on drug 1's potency at higher doses of drug 2. The converse holds for the C2 and alpha12 sliders. For the weaker drug, this can be most easily seen when beta $\\neq$ 0. For instance if E1 $\\lt$ E2 (meaning drug 2 is weaker), the impacts of the alpha12 slider are easiest to see if beta $\\neq$ 0.\n",
